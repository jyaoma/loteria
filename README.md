## Lotería! by Jeremy Ma

Lotería (Spanish for "lottery") is a game of chance. Each player gets a "tabla" (or "board") containing a 4x4 grid of random cards.
      
During play, the dealer draws cards from a deck one-by-one and the card is announced to everyone. If your tabla contains the card that was announced, click on it to mark it.
      
The goal of the game is to mark cards in one of the below patterns. Once you do, click on the "Lotería!" button to win!
